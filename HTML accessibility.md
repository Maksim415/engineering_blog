HTML Accessibility
===

The importance of HTML accessibility and its implementation is vital for anyone working with HTML. Unfortunatley, some developers believe that  accessibility is only a niche and should be ignored. However, all developers must incorporate accessibility into their code, thereby making it available to a broad range of visitors.

### What is Accessibility?

Accessibility contains two factors e.g.

1) How users with disabilities access electronic information. 

2) How web developers enable web pages to function with assistive devices used by individuals with disabilities.

Assistive technologies such a screen reader is only one piece of technology used by people with disabilities. Additionally, people with hearing impairments use captions to access video and audio. And, users with mobility impairments use assistive technology as well. A mobility impairment could mean that a user is unable to use a traditional keyboard, therefore assistive software is used to help them navigate the web using voice commands. These technologies are compatible with accessibile code, because good developers make accessible the main priority.

### Why is Accessibility Important?

Accessibility is important for a variety of reasons. e.g. 

1) It is the right thing to do. Accessibility represents an important step toward autonomy for people with disabilities. A web developer should strive to make his website accessible to as many users as possible. If a developer decides to neglect accessibility, he reduces the amount of users on his website. In many instances, this results in giving an advantage to your competitors whose site  is accessible. 

2) Accessibility offers benefits for all. Following a universal design, reduces the amount of time spent on maintenance and development. Additionally, accessible web pages are easier to read, easier to navigate, and faster to load.

3) Among many institutions and countries such as, the United States and Canada, legal mandates exist for accessibility. In the United States, Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act sets standards for web pages designed or maintained by the federal government. Additionally universities such as, the University of Wisconsin at Madison implemented an accessibility policy requiring all pages published by the university to assent to the WCAG checkpoints.

4) Accessibility offers great potential for businesses that implement an accessibility policy for two reasons. First, they reach a new customer base which results in increased revenue. Second, they are perceived as socially responsible for implementing such a policy.

### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of the information in the web pages, rather than merely define its presentation or look. [Semantic HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)

Prior to HTML5, many developers used HTML tags in order to make their webpage run. They were not concerned with using the appropriate tags. This became problematic for several reasons:
 
1) Computers had trouble processing faulty code, because tags were used in the wrong place or were simply recycled.

2)  Developers had trouble deciphering each others code. Different developers had different ways of writing a web pages. There were not semantics in place; this made collaborating difficult.

3) People with disabilities could not read a webpage because screen readers could not understand the semantics. This, resulted in the web page being displayed different on screen readers.

HTML5 was a major breakthrough, because it established semantic HTML as the norm across the board. 

### Conclusion

The importance of accessibility when writing code should be the main priority when writing code. Without accessibility good code cannot be written, since there is no set of rules in place to follow. Accessibility became standardized with HTML5 which laid the groundwork for semantic HTML. Today, all HTML code is writing using this model.
